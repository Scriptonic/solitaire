 Solitaire written using primarily JS and HTML


# Basic Overview

Creating a solitaire game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. Design the game: Start by sketching out the user interface and gameplay mechanics. What will the game board look like? How will the user interact with the game? What are the rules of the game?

2. Set up the HTML structure: Create a basic HTML structure for the game board, including placeholders for the cards, buttons, and other UI elements.

3. Style the game board: Use CSS to style the game board and UI elements. Consider using a pre-existing CSS framework like Bootstrap or Materialize to make the styling process easier.

4. Create the card deck: Use JavaScript to create an array of cards, each represented as an object with properties like suit, rank, and value. Shuffle the deck using a randomization algorithm.

5. Deal the cards: Use JavaScript to deal the cards to the game board. This may involve creating and positioning card elements on the game board using CSS.

6. Implement game logic: Use JavaScript to implement the game logic. This may include defining the rules for how cards can be moved around the board, detecting when the game has been won, and updating the game state as cards are moved.

7. Add interactivity: Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the game. This may include handling user input (such as clicking on cards to move them), updating the UI in response to game events (such as when a card is moved), and providing feedback to the user (such as when a move is illegal).

8. Test and refine: Test the game thoroughly, refining the code and UI as necessary to improve the user experience and ensure that the game works correctly.

Here are some specific tips and resources to help you get started:

- Start by creating a basic HTML file with placeholders for the game board and UI elements. You can use CSS to style these elements later.

- Consider using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Materialize to simplify the styling process.

- Use JavaScript to create an array of cards, shuffle the deck, and deal the cards to the game board. You may want to represent each card as an object with properties like suit, rank, and value.

- Implement the game logic using JavaScript. This may involve defining the rules for how cards can be moved around the board, detecting when the game has been won, and updating the game state as cards are moved.

- Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the game, such as handling user input (such as clicking on cards to move them), updating the UI in response to game events (such as when a card is moved), and providing feedback to the user (such as when a move is illegal).

- Test the game thoroughly, refining the code and UI as necessary to improve the user experience and ensure that the game works correctly.
